# MegaMenu

The mega menu component is used for displaying a big navigation menu with nested submenus displaying on hover.

<Preview>
  <Story id="components-mega-menu--primary" />
</Preview>

## How to Use

The mega menu renders a semantic `nav` element. It is made to work with `mega-menu-item` components. However, you can also write custom components for its slot.


Example of using this component in a template, with a MegaMenuItem
```html
<mega-menu title="Some menu" navKey="" :mobileNavs="{}">
  <mega-menu-item to="/settings/main/account" imageSource="${constants.lobAssetsUrl}/dashboard/navbar/settings.svg" small>
    Some menu item
  </mega-menu-item>
</mega-menu>
```

# Mega Menu Item

The mega menu item component is used for displaying a single item in the nested submenu that's displayed on hover.

<Preview>
  <Story id="components-megamenu--item" />
</Preview>

## How to Use

The main navigation item component can render as a traditional link (hooked up to your app's routing) or as an anchor tag depending on if the link is internal to your app's routing or external.

You can optionally provide an image source as well as a subtitle to display for the item.

You can also choose to pass in the `small` prop in order to limit the amount of white space around the item.

Example of using this component in a template
```html
<mega-menu-item to="/overview" imageSource="overviewIconSrcFile" subtitle="Optional subtitle text here" :small="true">
  Overview
</mega-menu-item>
```
