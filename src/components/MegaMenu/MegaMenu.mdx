# MegaMenu

The mega menu component is used for displaying a big navigation menu with nested submenus displaying on hover.

<Preview>
  <Story id="components-mega-menu--primary" />
</Preview>

## How to Use

The mega menu renders a semantic `nav` element with a `ul`. It is made to work with `mega-menu-item` components. However, you can also write custom components for its slot as long as the root element is an `li` (for accessibility).

// TODO: finish this

Example of using this component in a template
```html
  <mega-menu>
    <!-- TODO -->
  </mega-menu>
```

# Mega Menu Item

The mega menu item component is used for displaying a single item in the menu that's displayed on hover.

<Preview>
  <Story id="components-mega-menu--item" />
</Preview>

## How to Use

The main navigation item component can render as a traditional link (hooked up to your app's routing) or as an anchor tag depending on if the link is internal to your app's routing or external.

Example of using this component in a template as a link.
```html
<mega-menu-item to="/overview" imageSource="overviewIconSrcFile" subtitle="Optional subtitle text here" :small="true">
  Overview
</mega-menu-item>
```

## Props

<ArgsTable story={PRIMARY_STORY} />
