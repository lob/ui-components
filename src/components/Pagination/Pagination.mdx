# Pagination

The pagination component is used for displaying a table's paging data such as the number of results and which results are current visible. It is also responsible for providing ways to page forward or backward through the table data.

<Preview>
  <Story id="components-pagination--first-page-active" />
</Preview>

## How to Use

The pagination component consumes data from its parent for display. 

It emits a `page-change` event when its buttons are clicked. The parent component can listen to this event and the emitted data to know which page of data to fetch and render next.

Example of the emitted event data
```js
{
  page: 3
}
```

Example of using this component in a template
```html
<pagination
  page="1"
  limit="10"
  total="30"
/>
```

## Props

<ArgsTable story={PRIMARY_STORY} />
