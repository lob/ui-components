# Pagination

The pagination component is used for displaying a table's paging data such as the number of results and which results are current visible. It is also responsible for providing ways to page forward or backward through the table data.

<Canvas of={FirstPageActive} />

## How to Use

The pagination component consumes data from its parent for display.

It emits a `change` event when its buttons are clicked. The parent component can listen to this event and the emitted data to know which page of data to fetch and render next.

Example of the emitted event data

```js
{
  page: 3;
}
```

Example of using this component in a template

```html
<pagination page="1" limit="10" total="30" />
```

### Internationalization

By default, the screen reader and mobile labels will display in English.

If you'd like to localize these labels, you can install `vue-i18n` into your application and provide the following translations in your required languages.

```js
{
  pagination: {
    pageSingleResultLabel: 'result',
    pageResultsLabel: 'results',
    firstPageLabel: 'Go to first page',
    prevPageLabel: 'Go to previous page',
    nextPageLabel: 'Go to next page',
    lastPageLabel: 'Go to last page',
    prevPageLabelMobile: 'Prev',
    nextPageLabelMobile: 'Next'
  }
}
```

## Props

<ArgTypes story={PRIMARY_STORY} />
