# Multiselect

Multiselect is a stylized, (soon-to-be**) accessible component that allows a user to filter a list of options based on what they type and select multiple options from the list.

**Keyboard navigation and compatibility with screen readers will be worked on in part 2.

## How to Use
To use the multiselect component, you must provide a `v-model`, an `id`, a `label`, and an array of `options`.

The multiselect will only accept `options` as an array of objects. They must have at least a `label` property and a `value` property. When an option is selected, the dropdown will emit an `update:modelValue` event with the updated array of selected options.

You can optionally provide a `placeholder` which will display in the select when a selection has not been made and will appear as a list header above the options.

Customizations exist for<br/>
(1) the size of the input/badges with the `size` prop: "default" or "small"<br/>
(2) Whether you want the search to match on `label`, `value`, or both<br/>
(3) The width of the input box - provide this in the form of a Tailwind width class, and it will constrain the actual text input box itself to whatever width you'd like

Example of using this component in a template

```js
const options = [
  { label: 'Ginny', value: 'Beth' },
  { label: 'Prudence', value: 'Mercedes' },
  { label: 'Brie', value: 'Nina' },
  { label: 'Jenny', value: 'Mercedes' }
];
const modelValue = [];
```
```html
<Multiselect
  id="pet"
  v-model="modelValue"
  id="pet" label="Pet"
  :options="options"
  placeholder="Pick a pet"
  inputWidthClass="w-40"
/>
```

Example of the emitted event data
```js
[{ label: 'Ginny', value: 'Beth' }]
```
