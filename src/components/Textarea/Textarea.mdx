# Textarea

A textarea component for entering large blocks of text in a form.

<Preview>
  <Story id="components-textarea--primary" />
</Preview>

## How to Use

Most of the time, radio buttons should be grouped together using a `radio-group` component. The `name` prop should be the same across the group so that (1) HTML can use it to figure out which group a radio button is in, and ensure that only one button in the group is selected and (2) screen readers can accurately group options together.

You can pass in the `v-model` prop to bind the textarea to the parent component's data model.

You can pass in a `@change` handler to trigger a custom function on change events. The `event` object will be emitted along with the `change` event.

```html
<textarea
  name="FancyTextarea"
  label="Fancy text"
  v-model="form.fancy"
/>
```
