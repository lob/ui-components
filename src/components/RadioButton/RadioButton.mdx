# Radio Button

A radio button typically represents a single option in a group of related choices. Only one can be selected at a time.

<Canvas of={Primary} />

## How to Use

Most of the time, radio buttons should be grouped together using a `radio-group` component. The `name` prop should be the same across the group so that (1) HTML can use it to figure out which group a radio button is in, and ensure that only one button in the group is selected and (2) screen readers can accurately group options together.

You can pass in the `v-model` prop to bind radio buttons to the parent component's data model.

You can pass in a `@click` handler to trigger a custom function on click events. The `event` object will be emitted along with the `click` event.

If nothing is provided in the slot, the label will be rendered by default. Alternatively, you can provide any sort of content to be rendered in place of the label.

```html
<RadioButton
  name="postcard-size"
  value="4x6"
  label="4x6"
  v-model="postcard.size"
  @click="handleClick"
/>
```

Example with slot that contains label and tooltip

```html
<RadioButton
  name="postcard-size"
  value="4x6"
  label="4x6"
  v-model="postcard.size"
  @click="handleClick"
>
  <div class="flex">
    {{ service.description }}
    <!-- this becomes the label -->
    <Tooltip />
  </div>
</RadioButton>
```
