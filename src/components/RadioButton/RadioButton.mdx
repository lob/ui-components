# Radio Button

A radio button typically represents a single option in a group of related choices. Only one can be selected at a time.

<Preview>
  <Story id="components-radio-button--primary" />
</Preview>

## How to Use

Most of the time, radio buttons should be grouped together using a `radio-group` component. The `name` prop should be the same across the group so that (1) HTML can use it to figure out which group a radio button is in, and ensure that only one button in the group is selected and (2) screen readers can accurately group options together.

You can pass in the `v-model` prop to bind radio buttons to the parent component's data model.

You can pass in a `@click` handler to trigger a custom function on click events. The `event` object will be emitted along with the `click` event.

There is an option to pass a slot through as part of the label. In Lob's use case, this is to add an icon and a tooltip to further explain radio button choices.

```html
<radio-button
  name="postcard-size"
  value="4x6"
  label="4x6"
  v-model="postcard.size"
  @click="handleClick"
/>
```
