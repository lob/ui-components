# Stepper

The stepper component is just a container with a margin for stepperItem components.

<Preview>
  <Story id="components-stepper--primary" />
</Preview>

## How to Use

The stepper renders some space for `stepper-item` components. However, you can also write custom components for its slot.


Example of using this component with two stepper-items.
```html
<stepper>
  <stepper-item position="first" variant="finished">
    First step
  </stepper-item>
  <stepper-item position="last" variant="active">
    Last step
  </stepper-item>
</stepper>
```

# Stepper Item

The stepper item component is used for displaying a single item in the nested stepper.

<Preview>
  <Story id="components-stepper--item" />
</Preview>

## How to Use

The stepper item component accepts two props: `variant` and `position`. Variant is used for the state of the step (finished, active, unfinished, error) and position is used for indicating if the step is the first, an intermediate one, or the last one.

Example of using this component.
```html
<stepper-item variant="unfinished" position="last">
  Last step
</stepper-item>
```
