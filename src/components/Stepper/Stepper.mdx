# Stepper

The stepper component is just a container with a margin for `stepper-item` components.

<Canvas of={Primary} />

## How to Use

The stepper renders some space for `stepper-item` components. However, you can also write custom components for its slot.

Example of using this component with two stepper-items.

```html
<stepper>
  <stepper-item position="first" :finished="true"> First step </stepper-item>
  <stepper-item position="last" :active="true"> Last step </stepper-item>
</stepper>
```

# Stepper Item

The `stepper-item` component is used for displaying a single item in the nested stepper.

<Canvas of={Item} />

## How to Use

The stepper item is an atomic component that will render its state according to the props you pass in.

The `position` prop indicates its position within the parent `Stepper`. By default, all StepperItems will assume they are in a middle position but you can specify `first` or `last` for the first child and last child.

The `alignment` prop indicates what alignment you would like the marker within the item. By default, the alignment is `center` which will have the border line both to the left and right of the marker. You can specify either `left` or `right` alignment in order to move the marker so that there is a border on only one side. It is recommended that all StepperItems within a parent Stepper share the same alignment.

The `textVerticalAlign` prop indicates whether you want your stepper item text above (`top`) or below (`bottom`) of the markers. By default, the textVerticalAlign is `bottom`. It is recommended that all StepperItems within a parent Stepper share the same textVerticalAlign.

You can specify the `color` prop of the StepperItem. By default the marker and border will render in Lob's primary blue. If you provide a color, the marker and border will be updated to that color (we recommend importing the Tailwind colors into your component so you can be sure you are using approved brand colors).

If you'd like to control the border color independently of the marker color, you can provide a `borderColor` prop.

The final few props are booleans that toggle some state of the StepperItem.

`active` will add a larger border around the marker.

`finished` will add a checkmark inside the marker.

And `dashedBorder` will make the border behind the marker a dashed instead of a solid line.

Example of using this component.

```html
<stepper-item
  alignment="left"
  color="#ffb6db"
  border-color="#ccc"
  :dashed-border="true"
>
  Last step
</stepper-item>
```
