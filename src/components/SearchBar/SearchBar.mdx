# SearchBar

This search bar component is designed to render an input for the user to enter their search term and then a table with the search results. 

<Preview>
  <Story id="components-search-bar--primary" />
</Preview>

## How to Use

To use this component, you must provide a `searchFunction` to fetch search results. The function must return an array.

The table has a slot for you to define how to render a single result row which it will use to iterate and render each result. You can provide whatever markup you want to be rendered within the TableRow.

To use this component, here is an example

```html
<SearchBar
  searchFunction="myCustomSearch"
>
  <template
    #default="{ result }"
    class="min-w-full"
  >
    <td>
      <img class="w-5 h-5" :src="result.img" />
    </td>
    <td>
      {{ result.description }}
    </td>
    <td>
      {{ result.type }}
    </td>
    <td>
      >
    </td>
  </template>
</SearchBar>
```
