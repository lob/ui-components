# SearchBar

This search bar component is designed to render an input for the user to enter their search term and then a table with the search results.

<Canvas of={Primary} />

## How to Use

To use this component, you must provide a `searchFunction` to fetch search results. The function must return an array.

The component also has 3 optional props. Header an option to display the header for the search results. Count an option to display the a number of search results that differs from the number rendered. Link a link to see all the search results.

The table has a slot for you to define how to render a single result row which it will use to iterate and render each result. You can provide whatever markup you want to be rendered within the TableRow.

To use this component, here is an example

```html
<SearchBar searchFunction="myCustomSearch">
  <template #default="{ result }" class="min-w-full">
    <td>
      <img class="w-5 h-5" :src="result.img" />
    </td>
    <td>{{ result.description }}</td>
    <td>{{ result.type }}</td>
    <td>></td>
  </template>
</SearchBar>
```
