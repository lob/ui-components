# Modal

A modal is a card that is opened upon action to display information.

<Canvas of={Primary} />

## How to Use

Utilize the `Modal` component going forward

This `LegacyModal` component is designed to be used with slots to fill in its header and footer, and the default slot for its body.

Here is an example of a button opening a modal.

Visibility is controlled from the parent component using the `visible` prop. Note: this is not a `v-model`. You will need to update this when the `close` event is emitted.

The `header` prop (required) will provide the modal heading; no heading will render if an empty string is passed to the prop.

The `closeButtonAriaLabel` is also required, and will provide the close (X) button with an aria-label.

To add a footer, use the `#footer` slot. If no footer slot is provided, nothing will be rendered in it's place.

```html
<LobButton @click="isModalVisible = true"> Open Modal </LobButton>

<LegacyModal
  :visible="isModalVisible"
  header="Select Tracking Events"
  closeButtonAriaLabel="Close Modal"
  @close="isModalVisible = false"
>
  Would you like to export an additional CSV of associated tracking events?
  <RadioGroup>
    <radio-button
      name="exportCSV"
      value="yes"
      label="Yes"
      v-model="radioModel"
    />
    <radio-button name="exportCSV" value="no" label="No" v-model="radioModel" />
  </RadioGroup>

  <template v-slot:footer>
    <div class="flex self-end">
      <LobButton variant="secondary">Go back</LobButton>
      <LobButton variant="primary" class="ml-2">Submit</LobButton>
    </div>
  </template>
</LegacyModal>
```
