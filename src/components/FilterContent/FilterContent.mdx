# FilterContent

FilterContent is a stylized, accessible component for seeing a calendar and choosing a date.

<Preview>
  <Story id="components-filtercontent--primary" />
</Preview>

## How to Use
To use the filter content component, you must provide a `v-model:open` of type Boolean (controls whether the filter content is visible).

The filter content is positioned absolutely so you'll want to be sure to position its parent `relative` in order to have it show up in the proper position (it will always be positioned absolutely to its nearest ancestor that is positioned relative).

There are 2 slots. The default slot is for the various inputs and buttons that you want to display in your filters. The `header` slot is for rendering a user-friendly header to add further context to the filter content.

Finally, to hook up the functionality to close the calendar when clicking outside of the datepicker and its parent element, you can provide a `boundComponent` prop which is a ref to the element that the user can click in to hide/show the calendar (usually an input).

This component will emit `update:open` events with a boolean for whether the filter content is visible or not.

Example of using this component in a template without a header
```html
<div class="relative">
  <Button @click.stop="open = !open" size="small">Filter by</Button>
  <filter-content v-model:open="open">
    <checkbox
      label="Postcards"
      v-model="selectedFilters"
      name="postcards"
      value="postcards"
      class="mb-2"
    />
    <checkbox
      label="Letters"
      v-model="selectedFilters"
      name="letters"
      value="letters"
      class="mb-2"
    />
    <checkbox
      label="Checks"
      v-model="selectedFilters"
      name="checks"
      value="checks"
      class="mb-2"
    />
    <checkbox
      label="Self Mailer"
      v-model="selectedFilters"
      name="selfMailer"
      value="selfMailer"
      class="mb-2"
    />
    <div class="mt-4 flex">
      <Button variant="secondary" size="small" @click="selectedFilters = []">Reset</Button>
      <Button size="small" class="ml-2" @click="open = false">Apply</Button>
    </div>
  </filter-content>
</div>
```
