# Subnavigation

The subnavigation component is used for displaying a secondary, horizontal navigation.

<Canvas of={Primary} />

## How to Use

### Subnavigation

The subnavigation renders a semantic `nav` element with a `ul`. It is made to work with the `subnavigation-item` component. However, you can also write custom components for its slot as long as the root element is an `li` (for accessibility).

It accepts an optional `ulClass` prop. For Lob's purposes, this is so that we can make the subnavigivation full-width, however, you may pass in any valid Tailwind class(es) to apply to the `ul` element.

Example of using this component in a template:

```html
<subnavigation>
  <subnavigation-item title="Account" to="/account" />
  <subnavigation-item title="API Keys" to="/api-keys" />
  <subnavigation-item title="Payment" to="/payment" />
</subnavigation>
```

### Subnavigation Item

The subnavigation item component is used for displaying each individual tab in the subnavigation component. The subnavigation item component renders as link (hooked up to your app's routing) wrapped in an `li`.
