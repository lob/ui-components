## How to Use

### Subnavigation

The subnavigation renders a semantic `nav` element with a `ul`. It is made to work with the `subnavigation-item` component. However, you can also write custom components for its slot as long as the root element is an `li` (for accessibility).

Example of using this component in a template:

```html
<subnavigation v-bind="args">
  <subnavigation-item title="Account" to="/account" />
  <subnavigation-item title="API Keys" to="/api-keys" />
  <subnavigation-item title="Payment" to="/payment" />
</subnavigation>
```

### Subnavigation Item

The subnavigation item component is used for displaying each individual tab in the subnavigation component. The subnavigation item component renders as link (hooked up to your app's routing) wrapped in an `li`.

## Props

<ArgsTable story={PRIMARY_STORY} />
