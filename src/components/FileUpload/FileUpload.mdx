# File Upload 'Button'

The file upload 'button' is actually an input field with `type=file`, styled to look and act like Lob's secondary button. In addition to a mouse click, it can be triggered via the enter or space keys.

If placed in a container that has its width constrained in some way (e.g. with width or max-width) and the filename is long, the filename will be truncated with an ellipsis.

<Canvas of={Primary} />

## How to Use

An ID, a label, and an `accept` are all required props.

The label you pass in will be the button text when there is no file selected. When a file is selected, the label will change to be the file name.

The `accept` prop takes a string that defines the file types that the file input should accept. As with its corresponding HTML input, if you pass in multiple types, they should be comma-separated. You can read about file type specifiers [on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/file#unique_file_type_specifiers).

Only one file is able to be uploaded per button.

When a file is selected, a `fileUpload` event will be emitted along with the event object itself.

```html
<FileUpload id="file-upload" label="Choose File" accept=".pdf" />
```
