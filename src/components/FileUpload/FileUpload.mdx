# File Upload 'Button'

The file upload 'button' is actually an input field with `type=file`, styled to look and act like Lob's secondary button. In addition to a mouse click, it can be triggered via the enter or space keys.

<Preview>
  <Story id="components-fileupload--primary" />
</Preview>

## How to Use

An ID, a label, and an `accept` are all required props.

The label you pass in will be the button text when there is no file selected. When a file is selected, the label will change to be the file name.

The `accept` prop takes a string that defines the file types that the file input should accept. As with its corresponding HTML input, if you pass in multiple types, they should be comma-separated. You can read about file type specifiers [on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/file#unique_file_type_specifiers).

Only one file is able to be uploaded per button.

When a file is selected, a `fileUpload` event will be emitted along with the event object itself.

```html
<FileUpload
  id="file-upload"
  label="Choose File"
  accept=".pdf"
/>
```
