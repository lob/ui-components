# Button

Buttons are styled semantic buttons that will handle all of the appropriate button states.

<Preview>
  <Story id="components-button--primary" />
</Preview>

## How to Use

There are 7 variants of buttons: `'primary'` (default), `'secondary'`, `'quiet'`, `'ghost'`, `'danger'`, `'secondary-danger'` and `'link'` style.

You can change the variant of the button by adding the `variant` prop (String) to the component.

The Button can be `'small'`, `'medium'`, `'large'` (default), or `'xl'`, defined by the `size` prop (String).

Please note: though you can only insert text in the Storybook demo, the button component will accept any valid HTML or Vue component, as it uses a slot.
