# Button

Buttons are styled semantic buttons that will handle all of the appropriate button states.

<Preview>
  <Story id="components-button--primary" />
</Preview>

## How to Use

There are 3 variants of buttons: primary, secondary, and tertiary. By default, the button will display as primary.

You can change the variant of the button by adding the `variant` prop to the component.

There are 3 sizes of buttons: default, small, and large.

You can change the size of the button by adding the `size` prop to the component.

Please note: though you can only insert text in the Storybook demo, the button component will accept any valid HTML or Vue component.

<lob-button>
