# Button

Buttons are styled semantic buttons that will handle all of the appropriate button states.

<Preview>
  <Story id="components-button--default" />
</Preview>

## How to Use

There are 2 variants of buttons: 'primary' & 'secondary'; as well as 'link' style.

You can change the variant of the button by adding the `variant` prop (String) to the component.

The Button can be regular size (default, height: 48px) & or small (32px) with the `small` prop (Boolean).

The `warning` prop (Boolean) will change the button color to dark red if primary, and red outline if secondary.

Please note: though you can only insert text in the Storybook demo, the button component will accept any valid HTML or Vue component, as it uses a slot.

Example of using this component as a primary button in a template

```html
<lob-button> This is a primary button </lob-button>
```

Example of using this component as a secondary button in a template

```html
<lob-button variant="secondary"> This is a secondary button </lob-button>
```

## Props
