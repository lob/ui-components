# DateInput

DateInput is a wrapper component to bind a Datepicker to a TextInput. It's been added to this component library so Lob projects use the same date input throughout.

<Canvas of={Primary} />

## How to Use

To use the date input component, you must provide a `v-model` of type Date, a `v-model:open` of type Boolean (controls whether the calendar is visible), an `id`, and a label.

The date input will also accept `min` and `max` properties (also Date objects) to control how far forward or back the calendar will render. By default, it will go 1 year in the past and 1 year in the future.

You can also provide an `srOnlyLabel` prop which will hide the label from sighted users if true.

If you need the Datepicker to be right-justified when the calendar is open, set `rightJustified` to true.

You can use the props `disableWeekends` (boolean) to disable weekend days, and `disableHolidays` (boolean) to disable all US Federal holidays on the calendar.
_(New Years Day, Martin Luther King Jr Day, Juneteenth, Presidents Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans Day, Thanksgiving, Christmas)_

The `error` (boolean) prop will set the error state on the input, and if also passing an `errorMessage` (string), the error message will display underneath the input.

This component will emit an `update:modelValue` event with the selected date as a vanilla JS Date object.

It will also emit `update:open` events with a boolean for whether the calendar is visible or not.

Note: if this input does not format your date correctly or you need more functionality, you should make a custom component in your application's repo.

Example of using this component in a template with simple string options

```js
const startDate = new Date();
const startDateOpen = false;
```

```html
<date-input
  v-model="startDate"
  v-model:open="startDateOpen"
  id="startDate"
  label="Start date"
  :sr-only-label="true"
/>
```

### Internationalization

By default, the date format will be `yyyy-MM-dd`.

If you'd like to localize this format, you can install `vue-i18n` into your application and provide the following translation in your required languages.

```js
{
  dateFormat: 'yyyy-MM-dd';
}
```
