# MegaButton

<Canvas of={MegaText} />
<Canvas of={WithImage} />
<Canvas of={SmallText} />

## How to Use

There are 3 forms of megabuttons:

1. A large text, or mega text version, which just shows the label, given as either a prop or a `#label` slot. Unsurprisingly, this form uses a much larger text size than the others.

2. The label with text version, which uses its label as a heading and accepts a text prop or a `#text` slot.

3. An image version, which uses an imageSource prop to (you're not going to believe this) display an image.

The format changes automatically based on which props you provide. Just give it a label, and it'll be a mega text. Provide an imageSource and you get the image version. Give it text and it'll format itself appropriately.

Example of using this component in its mega text format in a template:

```html
<MegaButton
  name="reward-choice"
  id="kitten"
  value="kitten"
  label="Free Kitten"
/>
```

## MegaButtonGroup

If using a group of MegaButtons, wrap them in a `RadioGroup` so that they get wrapped in a `fieldset` and have an associated `legend`.

## Props

<ArgTypes story={PRIMARY_STORY} />
