# MegaButton

To do

## How to Use

There are 8 variants of buttons: 'primary', 'secondary', 'tertiary', 'success', 'alert', 'error', 'link', 'none'. By default, the button will display as primary.

You can change the variant of the button by adding the `variant` prop to the component.

There are 3 sizes of buttons: default, small, and large.

You can change the size of the button by adding the `size` prop to the component.

Please note: though you can only insert text in the Storybook demo, the button component will accept any valid HTML or Vue component.

Example of using this component as a primary button in a template

```html
<MegaButton
title='Sign up'>

</MegaButton>
```
