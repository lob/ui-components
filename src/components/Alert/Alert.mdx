# Alert

Alerts are a flexible component used to display highlighted content prominently.

<Preview>
  <Story id="components-alert--primary" />
</Preview>

## How to Use

There are 4 variants of alerts: `info`, `success`, `warning`, and `error`. By default, the alert will display as the info variant.

You can change the variant of the alert by adding the `variant` prop to the component.

All main content goes into the default slot. To add a heading for the Alert, use the slot `#heading`.

To hide the Alert Icon, set the `showIcon` prop to false.

To include a Close (x) button, add the `showCloseButton` prop as true. The button will emit `close` on click.

If adding a `learnMoreLink`(String) to be displayed, the link display text can also be set as the `linkDisplayText` (defaults to 'Learn more').

Please note: though you can only insert text in the Storybook demo, the component will accept any valid HTML or Vue component.

Example of using this component as a default info alert in a template

```html
<alert>
  <p>
    You are in <span class="bold">LIVE</span> mode, all verifications will be
    charged according to your <a href="#">chosen plan</a>.
  </p>
</alert>
```

Example of using this component as a warning with a heading

```html
<alert variant="warning">
  <template v-slot:heading> Alert heading! </template>
  <p>
    You are in <span class="bold">LIVE</span> mode, all verifications will be
    charged according to your <a href="#">chosen plan</a>.
  </p>
</alert>
```
