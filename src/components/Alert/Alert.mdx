# Alert

Alerts are a flexible component used to display highlighted content prominently.

<Preview>
  <Story id="components-alert--primary" />
</Preview>

## How to Use

There are 4 variants of alerts: info, success, warning, and error. By default, the alert will display as info.

You can change the variant of the alert by adding the `variant` prop to the component.

Please note: though you can only insert text in the Storybook demo, the card component will accept any valid HTML or Vue component.

Example of using this component as a default info alert in a template

```html
<alert>
  <p>
    You are in <span class="bold">LIVE</span> mode, all verifications will be
    charged according to your <a href="#">chosen plan</a>.
  </p>
</alert>
```

Example of using this component as a warning alert in a template

```html
<alert variant="warning">
  <p>
    You are in <span class="bold">LIVE</span> mode, all verifications will be
    charged according to your <a href="#">chosen plan</a>.
  </p>
</alert>
```

Example of using this component with a link

```html
<alert>
  <template v-slot:default="{linkColor}">
    {{ content }}
    <span :class="linkColor">
      <LobLink bold inherit-text-color>{{ link }}</LobLink>.
    </span>
  </template>
</alert>
```

To ensure correct styling of links passed into the Alert component's slot, make sure to wrap the `<LobLink>` in a `<span>`.

Pass the `linkColor` prop to the `<span>` as a class. Also pass `bold` and `inherit-text-color`to the`<LobLink>`
