# Modal

A modal is a card that is opened upon action to display information.

<Preview>
  <Story id="components-modal--primary" />
</Preview>

## How to Use

This Modal component is designed to be used with slots to fill in its header, body and footer.

Here is an example of a button opening a modal.

Visibility is controlled from the parent component using v-model.

```html
<Button @click="isModalVisible = true">
  Open Modal
</Button>

<Modal
  v-model="isModalVisible"
  @close="isModalVisible = false"
>
  <template v-slot:header>
    <h3>Important!</h3>
  </template>

  <template v-slot:body>
    Within the modal's body, there is very important information.
    <br/>
    <b>Please read carefully</b>
  </template>

  <template v-slot:footer>
    And here you would have some actions to perform.
  </template>
</Modal>
```
