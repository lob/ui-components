# Link

Links are styled semantic links. If you pass through a relative path (e.g. `/settings`), the link will become a router-link integrated with Vue router. If you pass through an external URL, the link will become an anchor tag.

<Preview>
  <Story id="components-link--primary" />
</Preview>

## How to Use

There are 4 variants of links: default, primary-button, secondary-button and alert-button. You can change the variant of the button by adding the `variant` prop to the component. primary-button, secondary-button and alert-button are styled so that they look like primary, secondary and alert buttons.

There are 2 sizes of buttons: default and small. You can change the size of the button by adding the `size` prop to the component.

There is an underline property for the text which is enabled by default.

Please note: though you can only insert text in the Storybook demo, the link component will accept any valid HTML or Vue component.

Example of using this component as a default link in a template

```html
<lob-link to="/internal"> Click me </lob-link>
```

Example of using this component as a secondary-button, small link in a template

```html
<lob-link variant="secondary-button" size="small" to="/internal">
  Click me
</lob-link>
```

Using the component with `target="_blank"` will automatically add `rel="noopener noreferrer"` to the link

```html
<lob-link target="_blank"> Click me </lob-link>
```
