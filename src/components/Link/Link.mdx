# Link

Links are styled semantic links. If you pass through a relative path (e.g. `/settings`), the link will become a router-link integrated with Vue router. If you pass through an external URL, the link will become an anchor tag.

<Preview>
  <Story id="components-link--regular-link" />

## How to Use

There are 3 variants of links: `link` (default), `primary-button` & `secondary-button`.
You can change the variant of the button by adding the `variant` prop (String) to the component.
The primary-button & secondary-button variants are styled so that they look like the primary & secondary Buttons.

There are 2 sizes of buttons: regular (default) and small. For a small button add the `small` prop (Boolean) to the component.

There is an underline property for the regular link text which is enabled by default. To disable it add the prop `:underline:"false"`.

The `disabled` property applies disabled styles as well as prevents clicks via CSS.

Please note: though you can only insert text in the Storybook demo, the link component will accept any valid HTML or Vue component.

Example of using this component as a default link in a template

```html
<lob-link to="/internal"> Click me </lob-link>
```

Example of using this component as a secondary-button, small link in a template

```html
<lob-link variant="secondary-button" small to="/internal"> Click me </lob-link>
```

Using the component with `target="_blank"` will automatically add `rel="noopener noreferrer"` to the link

```html
<lob-link target="_blank"> Click me </lob-link>
```
