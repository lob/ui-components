# LoadingIndicator

LoadingIndicator is a "dumb" component used to display a loading spinner until content is present in its default slot.

To display the loading spinner, wrap all of your conditional content with this component and put a v-if on it so that it renders when loading is complete (data is fetched, calculations are done, etc). The loading spinner will display automatically until your content is rendered.

<Canvas of={Primary} />

## How to Use

```html
<loading-indicator>
  <p v-if="someLoadingCondition">I am a card.</p>
</loading-indicator>
```

## Props

<ArgTypes story={PRIMARY_STORY} />
