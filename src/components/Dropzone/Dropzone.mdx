# Dropzone

The Dropzone is a form field with an input type=file, styled to look like a drop area.

In addition to a mouse click that opens the select-file dialog, the drop zone can accept files being drag&dropped onto it.

It supports single file selection (or drop), and has built-in checks for the file type and size (based on props).

<Canvas of={Primary} />

## How to Use

All text shown in the Dropzone must be added as the `textContent` prop (Object).

The required keys for the `textContent` are: `dragAndDropHere`, `yourFile`, `or`, `uploadFileButtonText`,
`acceptedFormatIs`, `acceptedFormatsAre`, `maxFileSizeIs`, `downloadSampleFile`,
`uploading`, `mightTakeAMinute`, `looksGreat`, `removeFileButtonText`, `fileFor`,
`couldNotUpload`, `canOnlySelectOneFile`, `fileIsTooLarge`, `fileTypeNotValid`,
`defaultErrorText`, `errorMessage`, `successMessage`

The prop `inputId` is also required (so that two or more Dropzones can be added to the same page).

```html
<Dropzone
  input-id="dropzone"
  accept-type=".csv"
  max-size-in-bytes="2147483648"
  :show-type-and-max-size="true"
  :show-sample-link="false"
  :status="null"
  :file="fileObject"
  :text-content="textContentObject"
  @select="uploadFile"
  @remove="removeFile"
/>
```

Other supported props (optional):

`acceptType`: takes a comma delimited string list that is passed into the `accept` file types of the input. (example: '.csv' or '.jgpeg,.jpg,.png')

`maxSizeInBytes`: the maximum accepted file size in bytes (as a Number) (example: 2147483648, will be shown as 2GB)

`showTypeAndMaxSize`: (Boolean) shows the type/size information text below the Dropzone

`sampleLinkUrl`: (String) if a url is added, the sample file link shows text below the Dropzone

`progress`: if a Number is provided, the `ProgressBar` will show the progress percentage

`file`: the file Object, to support showing the status of a previously uploaded file

`status`: the status of a previously upoloaded file as a String (only accepts null, 'error', or 'success')
