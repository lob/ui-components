# MainNavigation

The main navigation component is used for displaying the main, vertical navigation.

## How to Use

The main navigation renders a semantic `nav` element with a `ul`. It is made to work with `main-navigation-item` components. However, you can also write custom components for its slot as long as the root element is an `li` (for accessibility).

The main navigation has a single prop, `collapsible` to control whether it has a click event on desktop that animates the navigation on click to slide in to a smaller width. This can give the user more screen real estate. `collapsible` defaults to true. If you do not want this animation, set this to false.

When `collapsible` is true, the main navigation component passes information about it's expanded/collapsed state through slot props. This requires you passes the expanded prop to the child components in the template (see example below).

Example of using this component in a template

```html
<main-navigation v-bind="args">
  <template v-slot="{ expanded }">
    <main-navigation-item
      title="Overview"
      iconSrc="overviewIconSrcFile"
      iconAltText="Overview icon"
      to="/overview"
      :expanded="expanded"
    />
    <main-navigation-item
      title="Address Verification"
      iconSrc="addressVerificationIconSrcFile"
      iconAltText="Address verification icon"
      :subNavCollapsed="false"
      :expanded="expanded"
    >
      <main-navigation-child-item
        title="US Verifications"
        to="/us-verifications"
      />
      <main-navigation-child-item
        title="Int'l Verifications"
        to="/intl-verifications"
      />
    </main-navigation-item>
  </template>
</main-navigation>
```

# Main Navigation Item

The main navigation item component is used for displaying a top level navigation item in the main, vertical navigation.

<Preview>
  <Story id="components-main-navigation--item" />
</Preview>

## How to Use

The main navigation item component can render as a traditional link (hooked up to your app's routing) or as a button that will show its child nav items on click.

If you pass a `to` property, it will render as a link. Otherwise, it will render as a button.

The `bold` prop makes the text inside the main-navigation-item bolded.

The `expanded` prop should come from the parent main navigation component and will control whether the item renders at full width on desktop or only renders wide enough to show its icon.

Example of using this component in a template as a link.

```html
<main-navigation-item
  title="Overview"
  iconSrc="overviewIconSrcFile"
  iconAltText="Overview icon"
  to="/overview"
  :expanded="expanded"
  :bold = "true"
/>
```

If you provide children elements in the default slot, it will bind a click event to the button to hide/show the child nav items. If you do not want to allow the user to collapse this subnavigation (i.e. you want the child items always visible), set the `collapsible` prop on the main navigation item component to false.

If you want the component to render with the child items collapsed by default, you can use the `subNavCollapsed` prop set to true.

Example of using this component in a template as a button with child nav items.

```html
<main-navigation-item
  title="Address Verification"
  iconSrc="addressVerificationIconSrcFile"
  iconAltText="Address verification icon"
  :expanded="expanded"
>
  <main-navigation-child-item title="US Verifications" to="/us-verifications" />
  <main-navigation-child-item
    title="Int'l Verifications"
    to="/intl-verifications"
  />
</main-navigation-item>
```

# MainNavigationChildItem

The main navigation child item component is used for displaying a sub level navigation item in the main, vertical navigation.

## How to Use

The main navigation child item component renders as link (hooked up to your app's routing).

Example of using this component in a template

```html
<main-navigation-child-item title="US Verifications" to="/us-verifications" />
```
