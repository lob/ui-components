# AdvancedSearchBar

This Advanced Search Bar component is designed to render an input for the user to enter their search term and then return multi tabled search from Recipients, Campaigns and Templates.

<Canvas of={Primary} />

## How to Use

To use this component, you must provide a `searchFunction` to fetch search results. The function must return an array. The array must contain objects for each result group with nested results within it.

The component also has 3 optional props. Count an option to display the a number of search results that differs from the number rendered. Link a link to see all the search results. Footer an option to display the footer for the search results.

The table has a 2 slots, Header slot for you to define the header for each result group and body how to render a single result row which it will use to iterate and render each result. You can provide whatever markup you want to be rendered within the slots.

To use this component, here is an example

```html

<AdvancedSearchBar searchFunction="myCustomSearch">
  <template #header="{result} class="min-w-full">
    <Icon v-if="result.icon" class="mr-1" :icon="result.icon"/>
    {{ result.title }}
  </template>
  <template #body="{ result }">
    <div v-if="result">
      {{ result.name }}
    </div>
  </template>
</AdvancedSearchBar>
```
