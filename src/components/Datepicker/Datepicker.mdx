# Datepicker

Datepicker is a stylized, accessible component for seeing a calendar and choosing a date.

<Preview>
  <Story id="components-datepicker--primary" />
</Preview>

## How to Use
To use the datepicker component, you must provide a `v-model` of type Date, a `v-model:open` of type Boolean (controls whether the calendar is visible), and an `id`.

The datepicker will also accept `min` and `max` properties (also Date objects) to control how far forward or back the calendar will render. By default, it will go 1 year in the past and 1 year in the future.

You can also provide an `isDateDisabled` prop which is function that takes a single Date object parameter and returns a boolean for whether that date is disabled. You can use this to disable weekends, holidays, etc. if needed.

If you would prefer that the calendar start on Mondays instead of Sundays,  you can provide a `firstDayOfWeek` prop set to 1 (the index of Monday) or any other index you'd like. By default, calendar weeks start on Sunday.

Finally, to hook up the functionality to close the calendar when clicking outside of the datepicker and its parent element, make sure to include `.stop` on the click event bound to the element that the user can click in to hide/show the calendar (usually an input). For example `<input @click.stop="open = !open" />`

This component will emit `input` and `update:modelValue` events with the selected date as a vanilla JS Date object. It is up to you to decide how you would like to format and display that value in any inputs or presentation components. ([dayjs](https://day.js.org/) is a great little library for easy parsing and formatting)

It will also emit `update:open` events with a boolean for whether the calendar is visible or not.

Example of using this component in a template with simple string options
```js
const dateModel = new Date()
const open = false
const isDateDisabled = (date) => {
  const dayOfWeek = date.getDay();
  return dayOfWeek === DaysOfWeek.Saturday || dayOfWeek === DaysOfWeek.Sunday;
};
```
```html
<label>
  Enter a date
  <input @click.stop="open = !open" :value="dateModel" ref="input">
</label>
<datepicker v-model="dateModel" v-model:open="show" :boundComponent="$refs.input"></datepicker>
```

### Internationalization

By default, the calendar labels, months, and days will display in English.

If you'd like to localize these labels, you can install `vue-i18n` into your application and provide the following translations in your required languages (please note that `dayNames`, `monthNames`, and `monthNamesShort` must be arrays for calendar iteration).
```js
{
  datepicker: {
    keyboardInstruction: 'You can use arrow keys to navigate dates',
    closeLabel: 'Close',
    dayNameZero: 'Sunday',
    dayNameOne: 'Monday',
    dayNameTwo: 'Tuesday',
    dayNameThree: 'Wednesday',
    dayNameFour: 'Thursday',
    dayNameFive: 'Friday',
    dayNameSix: 'Saturday',
    monthNameZero: 'January',
    monthNameOne: 'February',
    monthNameTwo: 'March',
    monthNameThree: 'April',
    monthNameFour: 'May',
    monthNameFive: 'June',
    monthNameSix: 'July',
    monthNameSeven: 'August',
    monthNameEight: 'September',
    monthNameNine: 'October',
    monthNameTen: 'November',
    monthNameEleven: 'December',
    prevMonthLabel: 'Previous',
    nextMonthLabel: 'Next'
  }
}
```
