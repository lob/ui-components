## How to Use

Exposes a similar props interface as a `TextInput` with `type="number"` - i.e. a numeric `v-model` binding, as well as `min` and `max` fields. You can pass all supported props to the contained `TextInput` component via `inputProps`.
Icons are available for the left, right, or both sides of the input via `iconLeft` and `iconRight` named slots.

## Props

<ArgsTable story={PRIMARY_STORY} />
