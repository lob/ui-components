# Switch Group

A switch group represents a group of switch toggles.

<Canvas of={Primary} />

## How to Use

Wrap all switch items in a switch group with the title of the group passed in through the `legend` prop.

If you don't want the legend visible, pass in `srOnlyLegend` as true. When the legend is hidden, it will still be accessible to screen readers.

```html
<switch-group legend="Environment mode">
  <switch-item name="mode" label="Test" value="test" v-model="switchModel" />
  <switch-item name="mode" label="Live" value="live" v-model="switchModel" />
</switch-group>
```

# Switch Item

The switch item component is used for rendering a specific toggle item in the switch group.

## How to use

Switch items should be grouped together using a `switch-group` component. The `name` prop should be the same across the group so that (1) HTML can use it to figure out which group a switch item is in, and ensure that only one item in the group is selected and (2) screen readers can accurately group options together.

You can pass in the `v-model` prop to bind radio buttons to the parent component's data model.

You can pass in a `@click` handler to trigger a custom function on click events. The `event` object will be emitted along with the `click` event.

```html
<switch-item
  name="mode"
  value="test"
  label="Test"
  v-model="environmentMode"
  @click="handleClick"
/>
```
