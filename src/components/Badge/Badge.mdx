# Badge

Badges are a flexible component used to display small nuggets of text prominently.

<Preview>
  <Story id="components-badge--primary" />
</Preview>

## How to Use

There are 6 variants of badges: info, success, warning, error, turquoise, and flint. By default, the badge will display as info.

You can change the variant of the badge by adding the `variant` prop to the component.

There are also 2 shapes of badges: rounded and square. By default, the badge will display as rounded.

You can change the shape of the badge by adding the `shape` prop to the component.

Please note: though you can only insert text in the Storybook demo, the card component will accept any valid HTML or Vue component.

Example of using this component as a default rounded info badge in a template

```html
<Badge>
  <p>You are in <span class="bold">LIVE</span> mode, all verifications will be charged according to your <a href="#">chosen plan</a>.</p>
</Badge>
```

Example of using this component as a square warning badge in a template

```html
<Badge variant="warning" shape="square">
  <p>You are in <span class="bold">LIVE</span> mode, all verifications will be charged according to your <a href="#">chosen plan</a>.</p>
</Badge>
```
