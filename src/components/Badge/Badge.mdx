# Badge

Badges are a flexible component used to display small nuggets of text prominently.

<Canvas of={Primary} />

## How to Use

There are 6 variants of badges: `default`, `secondary`, `info`, `success`, `warning`, and `error`.

You can change the variant of the badge by adding the `variant` prop to the component.

There are 2 sizes of badges: `default` and `small`.

To change the size of the badge add the `size` prop to the component.

Please note: though you can only insert text in the Storybook demo, the badge component will accept any valid HTML or Vue component.

Example of using this component as a default badge in a template

```html
<Badge>
  <p>
    You are in <span class="bold">LIVE</span> mode, all verifications will be
    charged according to your <a href="#">chosen plan</a>.
  </p>
</Badge>
```

## Props

<ArgTypes story={PRIMARY_STORY} />
