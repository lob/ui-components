# Text Input

A text input component for entering a line of text in a form.

<Preview>
  <Story id="components-text-input--primary" />
</Preview>

## How to Use

You can pass in the `v-model` prop to bind the text input to the parent component's data model.

If you want a `copy` button, you can pass in the `withCopyButton` prop.

If you want to select all text on clicking the text box, you can pass in the `selectOnClick` prop.

Icons are available for the left, right, or both sides of the input via `iconLeft` and `iconRight` named slots.

A clear button appears on the right side of the input when clearButton is set to true. Clicking the button will clear the text in the input.

The `selectedOptions` named slot is specifically for the Multiselect component.

You can pass in a `@change` handler to trigger a custom function on change events. The `event` object will be emitted along with the `change` event.

You can pass in a `@copy` handler to trigger a custom function on copy button click.

You can pass in a `@invalid` handler to trigger a custom function when the input is invalid. The `event` object's target will be emitted along with the `invalid` event.

```html
<text-input>
  <template v-slot:iconLeft>
    <searchIcon class="w-6 h-6" />
  </template>
</text-input>
```
