# Breadcrumb

A breadcrumb component renders a list of links to go back up the navigation hierarchy from where the user currently is back to the home page.

<Preview>
  <Story id="components-breadcrumb--primary" />
</Preview>

## How to Use

Include a breadcrumb in a layout or inside any component where you want to render a list of links for the user to have easy navigation back up the navigation hierarchy.

The breadcrumb component is route aware and will render a link for each matched route. Refer to [Vue's documentation](https://router.vuejs.org/guide/essentials/nested-routes.html) for information on how to configure your router for nested routing.

The displayed link text will use the route's name (refer to [Vue's documentation for named routes](https://router.vuejs.org/guide/essentials/named-routes.html)) or the last segment in the path if the route is not named.

You'll need to provide a `startName` to tell the component what to name the root route. If you want to include an icon at the start of your breadcrumbs, include an `iconSrc`. 

```html
<breadcrumb startName="Dashboard" />
```
