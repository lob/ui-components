# StepperVertical

The `StepperVertical` component is a vertical stepper component that takes in the `steps` as a prop (Array of Objects). Each step object must include the `pathName` that will be displayed.

It uses the `StepperVerticalItem` component to display the `step.displayName`, and the `activeStepIndex` prop to highlight the current step.

Clicking on a step emits `goToStep` and the steo Object to the parent.

default:

<Canvas of={Default} />

dark-mode:

<Canvas of={DarkMode} />

## How to Use

The `StepperVertical` will render its steps according to the `steps` prop you pass in.

It emits the selected step on-click with the `goToStep` property and the selected step Object.

To show the dark mode version, use the prop `darkMode` set to true.

Example of using the component:

```html
<StepperVertical
  :steps="[{ path: '/settings', pathName: 'Choose campaign settings' },
    { path: '/audience', pathName: 'Add target audience' }]"
  :active-step-index="activeStepIndex"
  @stepChange="handleStepChange"
/>
```
