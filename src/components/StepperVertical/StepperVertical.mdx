# StepperVertical

The `StepperVertical` component is a vertical stepper component that takes in the `steps` as a prop (Array of Objects).

It uses the `StepperVerticalItem` component to display the `step.pathName`.

By default it will show the first step as active - or it can selected a different step by passing it as the `currentStep` prop.

default:

  <Story id="components-steppervertical--default" />

dark-mode:

  <Story id="components-steppervertical--dark-mode" />
</Preview>

## How to Use

The `StepperVertical` will render its steps according to the `steps` prop you pass in.

It emits the selected step on-click with the `goToStep` property and the selected step Object.

To show the dark mode version, use the prop `darkMode` set to true.

Example of using the component:

```html
<StepperVertical
  :steps="[{ path: '/settings', pathName: 'Choose campaign settings' },
    { path: '/audience', pathName: 'Add target audience' }]"
  @goToStep="handleGoToStep"
/>
```
