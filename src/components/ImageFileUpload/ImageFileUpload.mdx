# Image File Upload

An image file upload component with image preview and drag and drop.

## Default Configuration

By default, the component will occupy the full height and width of its container and has a minimum height of 50px.
When an image file is selected, the image preview and remove button are positioned at the very left and right of the
component, respectively.

Note that files cannot be dropped directly onto the choose button and if the component is not wide enough, the drop zone
will be obscured by the choose button.

<Canvas of={Default} layout={'padded'} />

## Max File Size Error

Choose any image file larger than 1 byte to see the error state when the file size exceeds the configured `maxFileSize`.

<Canvas of={FileSizeError} layout={'padded'} />

## Props

<ArgTypes story={PRIMARY_STORY} />
