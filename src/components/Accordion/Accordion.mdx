# Accordion

Accordions are vertically collapsing components used for displaying or hiding large chunks of content

<Preview>
  <Story id="components-accordion--primary" />
</Preview>

## How to Use

Please note: though you can only insert text in the Storybook demo, the accordion component will accept any valid HTML or Vue component.

The prop `defaultOpen` can be passed to the Accordion to have the Accordion render open by default

```html
<accordion title="Content">
  <p>I am hidden content</p>
</accordion>
```

```html
<accordion title="Content" default-open="true">
  <p>I am open by default</p>
</accordion>
```

## Props

<ArgsTable story={PRIMARY_STORY} />
