# FloatingActionButton

A floating action button (FAB) is a circular button that hovers above the user interface
common or important action, such as creating a new item or performing a main action.
FABs are commonly used in material design to enhance the user experience and provide
quick access to key functionality.

<Canvas of={Primary} />

## How to Use

Provide a string value for `labelText` and `buttonText` props.
For the `buttonVariant` prop, you may use any possible value for the [Button](/docs/components-button--docs) component's 'variant' prop.

```html
<div>
  <FloatingActionButton
    labelText="2 mailpieces selected"
    buttonText="Cancel Mail Pieces"
    buttonVariant="danger-secondary"
  />
</div>
```

## Props

<ArgTypes story={PRIMARY_STORY} />
