# Button

Buttons are styled semantic buttons that will handle all of the appropriate button states.

<Preview>
  <Story id="components-newbutton--default" />
</Preview>

## How to Use

There are 2 variants of buttons: 'primary' & 'secondary'.

You can change the variant of the button by adding the `variant` prop to the component.

Please note: though you can only insert text in the Storybook demo, the button component will accept any valid HTML or Vue component.

Example of using this component as a primary button in a template

```html
<new-button> This is a button </new-button>
```

Example of using this component as a secondary button in a template

```html
<new-button variant="secondary"> This is a button </new-button>
```

## Props

<ArgsTable story={PRIMARY_STORY} />
