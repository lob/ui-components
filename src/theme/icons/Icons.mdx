# Icons

All of the icons from our design system exist as components you can use in this library. All of the icons will inherit the current color of their parent element or you can change the color by adding a class to the icon component, e.g. `class="text-gray-500"`

The Icon size is managed by the `size` prop (String) as `'xxl', 'xl', 'l', 'm', 's'`.
These correspond to 24px, 20px, 18px, 16px, and 14px width/height and viewbox values.
If a size is not declared, the default size is medium.

Here's an example of using an icon

```html
<File size="l" class="text-purple-500" />
```
