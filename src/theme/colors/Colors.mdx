# Colors

Our colors are configured in the shared Lob Tailwind config found in the [tailwind-plugin-lob repo](https://github.com/lob/tailwind-plugin-lob). We are overwriting Tailwinds default colors but we are using their naming conventions as much as possible. This should make it easier for developers with Tailwind experience to onboard.

To add or change colors, you'll need to edit the theme in the tailwind-plugin-lob repo and publish the package to npm. Then install the latest package and restart your server.

Please refer to [Tailwind's documentation for customizing colors](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors) for more info.
