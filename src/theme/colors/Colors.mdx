# Colors

Our colors are configured in `tailwind.config.js`. We are overwriting Tailwinds default colors but we are using their naming conventions as much as possible. This should make it easier for developers with Tailwind experience to onboard.

To add or change colors, you'll need to edit our theme in `tailwind.config.js` and then restart your server.

Please refer to [Tailwind's documentation for customizing colors](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors) for more info.
