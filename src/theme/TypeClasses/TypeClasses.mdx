# Type Classes

Our font Type classes are configured in the shared Lob Tailwind config found in the [tailwind-plugin-lob repo](https://github.com/lob/tailwind-plugin-lob).

The classes are added to the theme with the use of the `addComponents` plugin.

Please refer to [Tailwind's documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/plugins) for more info on plugins.
