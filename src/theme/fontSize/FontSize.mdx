# Font Size

Our font sizes are configured in `tailwind.config.js`. We are overwriting Tailwinds default sizes slightly but we are using their naming conventions as much as possible. This should make it easier for developers with Tailwind experience to onboard.

To add or change sizes, you'll need to edit our theme in `tailwind.config.js` and then restart your server.

We are also adding some global styles to default text elements like headings and paragraphs for a better developer experience. This way we won't need to add classes to every text element for sizing.

Please refer to [Tailwind's documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/font-size) for more info.
